# first-python-project

this is my first time ever using python
this program is very algorithmic and sequential, and maybe not the most efficient
i try to comment on this project well to refer to and explain my thoughts
im also trying to implement a lot of error handling
currently, i have never made different functions in python so i guess everything is in 'main'
trying to format well but its a console app so...
yes, i am abusing os.system('cls')

only issue, how to end program completely after checkout?
